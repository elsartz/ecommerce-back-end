  # Installation
    It is a command-line application that's why we are going to need: 
   - Node.js to run the application and some modules from the npm library, 
     - Express.js to build the server,
     - MySQL2 module to handle the database queries,
     - Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

  # Usage
    To build the back end for an e-commerce site.
